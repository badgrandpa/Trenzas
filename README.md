------------------------

Amor Serrano tells the story of domestic violence in the Andes. 
Two testimonies of survivors have been recorded and translated from Spanish to English  and Quechua (native Andean language). 
This piece aims to bring the audience face to face with  the epidemic of feminicide happening in Peru and therefore trigger a 
reaction and create discourse on this topic.
