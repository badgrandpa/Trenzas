------------------------

Amor Serrano tells the story of domestic violence in the Andes. 
Two testimonies of survivors have been recorded and translated from Spanish to English  and Quechua (native Andean language). 
This piece aims to bring the audience face to face with  the epidemic of feminicide happening in Peru and therefore trigger a 
reaction and create discourse on this topic.

I created a circuit using 6 capacitive sensors. Each sensing side was soldered onto long copper wires that in term where braided inside 6 foot long hair extensions. This borugh the hair to life and made it interactive. When touching the hair it triggered different audio tracks. Each of them narrating a testimony of a domestic abuse survivor.
